# README: Parametric-Plotter

---

## 1. Defining the Project

*What is the Project?*

The Plotter Project is a project to build a standalone desktop application that provide a user interface for plotting the graphs of 2D Parametric Equations is up to two parameters. The project is going to be solved with `C++` and *possibly* `python` or `opengl/glfw`. Users will be able to input the system of equations and domain to be plotted as typed strings and be able to select various option in the settings to customize graphing properties, including:

> - scaling of the viewport
> - aspect ratio of the viewport
> - number of samples that the plotter should utilize in it's calculations

<br>


*What is the MVP?*

The minimum viable product is a plotting app the renders with a GUI and be able to accept input for the system of equations and ranges for the parameters in a simple "click-to-build" style(dropdown menus for basic mathematical functions and such), computes and packages the data for display, and finally renders the plot of the described graph with basic GUI.

<br>

*What are the nice to haves?*

The nice to haves for this project are actual string comprehension for input in addition to easier "click-to-build" input, drag-to-pan and scroll-to-zoom support, and animated plotting.

<br>

*When will the project be complete?*

The project will be complete when at least the click-to-build input system, core plotting functionality, basic GUI in/out, and non-dynamic view options.

## 2. Creating the Workflow

Following a simple approach on my GitHub [Project page](https://github.com/users/corosivo/projects/2).
*Note:* The cards for this step can be more easily derived from the subjects of the following step

## 3. Breaking the project down into smaller components
